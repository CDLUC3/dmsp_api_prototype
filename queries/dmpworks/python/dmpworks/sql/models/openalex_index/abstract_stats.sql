/*
  openalex_index.abstract_stats:

  Collates abstract specific metadata for each unique DOI. DataCite works are
  excluded in openalex_index.works_metadata. The first SELECT processes OpenAlex
  works with duplicate DOIs, selecting the work with the longest abstract. The
  second SELECT processes non-duplicate works. Since this is the leftmost table
  in openalex_index.abstracts, it includes works also found in Crossref Metadata,
  even if their abstracts are NULL (no length), ensuring they are available for
  the subsequent step to check Crossref Metadata for more suitable abstracts.
