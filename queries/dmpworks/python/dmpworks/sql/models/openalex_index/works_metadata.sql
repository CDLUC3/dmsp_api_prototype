/*
  openalex_index.works_metadata:

  Filters out OpenAlex works that are also present in DataCite, and then
  collates metadata for the remaining works — including OpenAlex ID, DOI, title
  length, abstract length, a duplicate flag (whether another OpenAlex work
  shares the same DOI), it also counts the number of unique non null ids
  for each work, which are used to determine which work to use when works
  share the same DOI (the work with the most metadata).

  This table is used by downstream queries as the leftmost table in joins, so
  that non-DataCite OpenAlex works are used in further processing.
