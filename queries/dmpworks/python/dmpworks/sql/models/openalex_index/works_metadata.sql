/*
  openalex_index.works_metadata:

  Filters out OpenAlex works that are also present in DataCite, and then
  collates metadata for the remaining works â€” including OpenAlex ID, DOI, title
  length, abstract length and a duplicate flag (whether another OpenAlex work
  shares the same DOI).

  This table is used by downstream queries as the leftmost table in joins, so
  that non-DataCite OpenAlex works are used in further processing.
